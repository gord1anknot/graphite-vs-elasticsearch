## Graphite and Elasticsearch

- Open Source
- Come with tooling for use monitoring server operations (batteries included)

### Why use both?

*The way they model data is extremely different*

Note:
- Both tools have a query facility that can be optimized for time series data
- No offense, but SQL 2011 is waaay too little, waaay too late
- When troubleshooting a production issue at 2:00 AM, don't make me think about how to do a query. Using both keeps easy things easy.
